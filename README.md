I was trying to figure out a good project for my son and I to work on that would be cool to him, but also educational without getting too deep into programming.  
Welp, can't blame him for getting bored anyways and wanting to go play with his friends after 20min, so it became dad's project and I just told him about it afterwards haha.  
He absolutely loves it and has been showing it to everyone and anyone he can!  

There is a stainless-steel power button, so the arduino nano does not drain battery over time. Then a momentary button which functions as follows:  
**One Press** = On and off animation (light ascends and descends through blade).  
**Double Press** = Cycle through 5 default colors, last used color is saved upon turning saber back on.  

### I will upload photos of the build process soon, but here is the UNPAINTED final product!
